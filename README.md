hrsoo
==========

This is a little utility to help parse hours of operation strings.


**NOTE:** This is a work in progress and not ready yet

## Overview

A string that contains the hours of operation for a business can come in many different forms. For example:

* M-F 8-5, S 9-12
* 24 hours, 7 days
* Monday 8am EST through 4pm EST
* etc.

This library is an attempt to normalize any of these typical variations and output either a standard JSON
data structure that contains all the hours or a specific format.

## Installation

From the command line enter:

```
npm install hrsoo --save
```
